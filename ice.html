            <h2>ICE Challenge 1: Prophet Cards</h2>
            <p>
            The very first ICE challenge! This one was simple but also a great starting point to work on positioning, colors, fonts, and structure. It packed a lot of fundamentals into a short challenge.

        <h2>ICE Challenge 2: Favorite Devo Table</h2>
         <p>
         This challenge was about making tables to describe a devotional I liked. It was a great learning opportunity for making structure in tables and input boxes, and it also took some work on image resizing in order for the banner to fit.

            <h2>ICE Challenge 3: Holiday Page</h2>
            <p>
            This challenge had me make a Valentine's Day themed homepage. It was the first opportunity to really get creative with colors and formatting since it was more open ended. This taught me a lot about matching colors and making a coherent page layout.

            <h2>ICE Challenge 4: CSS Positioning</h2>
            <p>
             This was one of the most difficult challenges. I had to use a ton of different CSS tools to position the blocks in different ways to match examples. The concept itself was really simple, but I learned how to use a ton of different alignment and positining tools that I'm utilizing now!

            <h2>ICE Challenge 5: Country Flag Grid</h2>
            <p>
            This was probably my favorite challenge. I had recreate country flags with CSS! This taught me off the base that the last challenge made by giving it a full and more realistic application. I got more experience with colors, shapes, and positioning.

            <h2>ICE Challenge 6: Image Gallery Issues</h2>
            <p>
            This challenge was different and was really well suited to my strengths. The page initially loaded images super slowly, so I had to resize them in order to load faster. The resizing process was really fun and I applied this in a personal project.

            <h2>ICE Challenge 7: Signup Form Design</h2>
            <p>
            The last challenge was really fun and difficult. It had a similar approach to prophet cards, but creating a sign up form. It used Javascript which is quite new to me but I still had fun studying it. I combined some of everything, practicing, spacing, fonts, image resizing, and positioning.
